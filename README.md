About web scraping
Web scraping consists in gathering data available on websites. This can be done manually by a human user or by a bot. The latter can of course gather data much faster than a human user and that is why we are going to focus on this. Is it therefore technically possible to collect all the data of a website in a matter of minutes this kind of bot. The legality of this practice is not well defined however. Websites usually describe in their terms of use and in their robots.txt file if they allow scrapers or not.
